                     Abortion, the termination of a pregnancy, can occur for various reasons and through different methods depending on the stage of pregnancy, individual circumstances, and available medical resources. Broadly, abortions are categorized into two main types: spontaneous abortions (commonly known as miscarriages) and induced abortions, which are performed intentionally to end a pregnancy. Within induced abortions, there are several methods, each tailored to the gestational age of the fetus and the individual's medical needs.

                   <font size="4px">
                        Spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, occurs without intentional intervention. It is often caused by natural factors, such as chromosomal abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, or underlying health conditions. Common types of spontaneous abortions include:
                   </font>
                   <ul type="disc">
                    <li><h3>Complete miscarriage:</h3>All pregnancy tissue is expelled naturally</li>
                    <li><h3>Incomplete miscarriage:</h3>Some pregnancy tissue remains in the uterus, often requiring medical intervention.</li>
                    <li><h3>Threatened miscarriage:</h3>Symptoms such as bleeding or cramping occur, but the pregnancy may continue.</li>
                    <li><h3>Missed miscarriage:</h3>The fetus stops developing, but there are no immediate symptoms, and the tissue remains in the uterus.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h2>Induced <font color="red">Abortion</font></h2>
                   Induced abortion is the intentional termination of a pregnancy through medical or surgical means. The methods used depend on factors such as how far along the pregnancy is and the individualâ€™s health. Induced abortions are further classified as follows:
                   <h3>Medical <font color="red">Abortion</font></h3>
                   Medical abortion involves the use of medications to end a pregnancy. It is typically performed during the first trimester (up to 10 weeks of pregnancy) and is less invasive than surgical methods. Common medications used include:
                   <ul type="disc">
                    <li><h4>Mifepristone (RU-486):</h4>Blocks the hormone progesterone, necessary for pregnancy to continue.</li>
                    <li><h4>Misoprostol:</h4>Causes the uterus to contract and expel pregnancy tissue.Medical abortion is a non-surgical option that allows individuals to undergo the process in a more private setting.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>Surgical <font color="red">Abortion</font></h3>
                   Surgical abortion involves a medical procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the uterus. The most common methods include:
                   <ul type="disc">
                    <li><h4>Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA)</h4> A procedure performed in the early weeks of pregnancy, involving suction to remove tissue.</li>
                    <li><h4>Dilation and Curettage (D&C):</h4>Involves dilating the cervix and using surgical tools to remove the tissue.</li>
                    <li><h4>Dilation and Evacuation (D&E):</h4>Performed after the first trimester, combining suction and surgical instruments for tissue removal.</li>
                    <li><h4>Induction Abortion:</h4>Used in later pregnancies, where medications induce labor to expel the fetus.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>Other Classifications</h3>
                   In addtion to the above, there are situations which require specific types of abortion:
                   <ul type="disc">
                    <li><h4>Therapeutic Abortion</h4>Performed for medical reasons, such as to save the life or health of the pregnant person or address severe fetal anomalies.</li>
                    <li><h4>Elective Abortion</h4>Performed based on personal choice rather than medical necessity.</li>
                   </ul>
